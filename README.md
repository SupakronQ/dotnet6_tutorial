Today, I started learning .NET 6 by following an article from T&T Software Solution. The article provides a hands-on guide to setting up a project and writing basic code in .NET 6. This is an important first step in developing efficient and multi-platform applications. I hope this knowledge will help me grow as a software developer and create high-quality applications in the future.
